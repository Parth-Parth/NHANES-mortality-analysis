feature_corr.png

This visual shows the correlation matrix between features. In overview there is a number of feature groups, which show high degree of correlation. For example, LBXGH (Glycohemoglobin), DIQ050 (whether taking insulin), and LBXSGL (Glucose) are correlated with each other. Similarly, LBXSCH and LBXTC are also positively correlated, both of them are measures of cholesterol with different units. On the other hand, LBXLYPCT (Lymphocyte) and LBDNENO (Segmented neutrophils number) are negatively correlated.
